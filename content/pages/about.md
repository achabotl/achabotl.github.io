Hi, I'm Alexandre Chabot-Leclerc.

I'm a Python instructor and Scientific Software Developer at Enthought. I teach mainly the scientific and data science stacks, e.g. NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, etc. In a previous life I did a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark. I [worked on](http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/alexandre-chabotleclerc(c5cc68f9-80b6-45c6-9916-86f77a03af95).html) speech intelligibility modeling, which means I tried to model how we understand speech in difficult situations. I've written a few [papers and posters about that](publications). My ORCID is [0000-0001-6609-6023](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6609-6023).

I also wrote a Python package for auditory modeling called [PAMBOX](http://pambox.org). It stands for *Python auditory modeling toolbox*.

I'm interested in Python and programming, photography, teaching, climbing in general and bouldering in particular.

Once upon a time, I kept a blog in French called [Youskié Chabot?](http://youskiechabot.blogspot.dk) (roughly "Where is Chabot?") where I chronicled my adventures.
